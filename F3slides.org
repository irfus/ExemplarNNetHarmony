* Exemplar Approach to Vowel Harmony

** VH as an evolutionary process

- vowel harmony is the result of a diachronic process of sound change motivated by *perturbatory effects of coarticulation* on listener perception citep:ohala1994towards,blevins2004evolutionary
- evidence suggests it is possible to extract phonological rules corresponding to VH from coarticulatory patterns citep:przezdziecki2005vowel
  - counter-claim: phonetic basis for VH irrelevant from a synchronic point of view citep:anderson1980,nevins2010locality
- motivates search for models that integrate phonetic features and phonological structures

** Motivating the exemplar approach

- mental lexicon integrates detailed representations of *acoustic/auditory*, articulatory, *visual*, spatial, and even social inputs
- phonological structures are implicitly learnt through *repeated exposure to /exemplars/* of these inputs
- exemplar models have been argued to be particularly suited to *modelling language change* as an evolutionary process

* Connectionist models (a.k.a. Neural Networks)

** Connectionist models in linguistics
- linked to psycholinguistically motivated accounts of production/perception, and processing citep:dell1999connection,hawkins2001polysp,port1990representation
- proposed to be *compatible with emergent~/~exemplar accounts* of phonological acquisition citep:bybee2005alternativ,lathroum1989feature,hare1990role,rodd1997recurrent,cole2009emergent,alderete2018connectionist,cole2009emergent
- but, actual early implementations were often limited; toy models, sketches

** Where does this experiment come in?
- the success of /"deep learning"/ citep:manning2015computation
- it is now possible to train such models to learn *semantic representations directly* from raw, unannotated phonetic or text inputs
- resurgence of interest in testing if and how the representations learnt by such /"end-to-end"/ models maps to traditional linguistic structures citep:alishahi2017encoding,doucette2017inherent,gulordava2018colorless,ravfogel2018can,van2018modeling,enguehard2017exploring,linzen2016assessing

** Where does this experiment come in?
*** proposed aim:
- replicate methodology from cite:alishahi2017encoding to test the representation of VH structures in an RNN model trained in an *exemplar-compatible way*

*** why recurrent?
- recurrence allows processing *sequential inputs* (like speech)
- lets the network learn interactions between different portions of the input
  - sensitive to coarticulatory effects

*** not in scope:
- testing the biological plausibility of RNNs (/short answer: they're not/)
- modelling the actual phonological acquisition process

* Research Questions, Data, and Methods
** Research Questions
*** RQ1
- Can structures corresponding to vowel harmony classes be found through the vector representations learned by a /weakly-supervised/ "deep" RNN

*** RQ2
- If yes (to RQ1), then what is the hierarchical position of the layer(s) that best learns to represent these structures w.r.t. the rest of the network
  - Do the results of cite:alishahi2017encoding replicate?

** Dataset
- Aalto University DSP Course Conversation Corpus
- Finnish spontaneous conversations with force-aligned transcriptions (utterance, word, segment)
- 5200 utterances, 9.7hrs of audio from 218 male and 24 female speakers
- Finnish has backness harmony, proceeding left-to-right
- http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2017092133

** Model
*** Input
- Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) vectors, utterance level
*** Layers
- 1 convolutional, 5 recurrent
*** Output
- Embedding layer, trains to project utterance encoding and image encoding to a joint vector space
** Experiment
*** ABX discrimination task
- tuples of the form (A,B,X) where
  - A, B, and X are CV syllables
  - B and X vowels share harmonic class
- for each tuple, calculate \(sign(dist(A,X) - dist(B,X))\), where \(dist(i,j)\) is euclidean *distance between model's vector representations of syllables /i/ and /j/*
- +ve sign indicates that the model has learned to discriminate the VH classes in A and B

** VH in Finnish and Bangla
- Finnish: backness harmony, proceeds left-to-right
  - front or back vowel in the initial syllable spreads that feature to vowels in non-initial syllables
  - three harmonic classes - front [ä ö y]; back [a o u]; neutral [e i]\footnote{neutral vowels are unchanged by harmony}
  - e.g., pos+ahta+(t)a → posahtaa  (back)
  - räj+ahta+(t)a → räjähtää (front)
- Bangla: ATR harmony, proceeds right-to-left
  - ATR feature of suffixal vowels spreads to stem vowels
  - e.g., pɔtr+ika → potrika
  - khɛl+i → kheli
