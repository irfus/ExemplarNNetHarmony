* Exemplar Approach to Vowel Harmony

** VH as an evolutionary process

- vowel harmony is the result of a diachronic process of sound change motivated by perturbatory effects of coarticulation on listener perception citep:ohala1994towards,blevins2004evolutionary
- evidence suggests it is possible to extract phonological patterns corresponding to VH from coarticulatory patterns citep:przezdziecki2005vowel
  - counter-claim: phonetic basis for VH irrelevant from a synchronic point of view citep:anderson1980,nevins2010locality
- motivates search for models that integrate phonetic features and phonological structures

** Motivating the exemplar approach

- mental lexicon integrates detailed representations of acoustic/auditory, articulatory, visual, spatial, and even social inputs
- phonological patterns are implicitly learnt through repeated exposure to sequences of such inputs and 'words' are a natural organisational unit for this process (lexically driven learning)
- exemplar models have been argued to be particularly suited to modelling language change as an evolutionary process

* Connectionist models (aka Neural Networks)

** Connectionist accounts in linguistics
- linked to psycholinguistically motivated accounts of production/perception, and processing citep:dell1999connection,hawkins2001polysp,port1990representation
- proposed and/or shown to be compatible with emergent/exemplar accounts of phonological acquisition citep:bybee2005alternativ,lathroum1989feature,hare1990role,rodd1997recurrent,cole2009emergent,alderete2018connectionist,cole2009emergent
- but, actual early implementations were often limited in scope by constraints on computational processing and storage
** Where does this experiment come in?
- it is now possible to train such models to learn semantic representations directly from raw phonetic or text inputs with no annotation at the phonological or syntactic level
- resurgence of interest in testing if and how the representations learnt by such "end-to-end" models maps to traditional linguistic structures citep:alishahi2017encoding,doucette2017inherent,gulordava2018colorless,ravfogel2018can,van2018modeling,enguehard2017exploring,linzen2016assessing

** Where does this experiment come in?
proposed aim: replicate methodology from cite:alishahi2017encoding to test the representation of VH structures in an RNN model trained in an exemplar-compatible way \footnote{project repo: https://github.com/irfus/ExemplarNNetHarmony}
