* Research Questions and Hypothesis
** Research Questions
*** RQ1
- Can structures corresponding to vowel harmony classes be found through the vector representations learned by a /weakly-supervised/ "deep" RNN

*** RQ2
- If yes (to RQ1), then what is the hierarchical position of the layer(s) that best learns to represent these structures w.r.t. the rest of the network
  - Do the results of cite:alishahi2017encoding replicate?

** Hypothesis

- cite:alishahi2017encoding have shown that the vector representations learned by a deep RNN model do learn to represent phonemes with lower r-layers outperforming higher ones at phoneme discrimination
- if higher layers are able to learn more abstract structures (such as VH classes), then they should outperform the lower ones at a VH class discrimination task

* Data and Methods
** Dataset
- Aalto University DSP Course Conversation Corpus
- Finnish spontaneous conversations with force-aligned transcriptions (utterance, word, segment)
- 5200 utterances, 9.7hrs of audio from 218 male and 24 female speakers
- http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2017092133
** Model
*** Input
- MFCC vectors, utterance level
*** Layers
- 1 convolutional, 5 recurrent
*** Output
- Embedding layer, trains to project utterance encoding and image encoding to a joint vector space
** Experiment
*** ABX discrimination task
- tuples of the form (A,B,X) where
  - A, B, and X are CV syllables
  - B and X vowels share harmonic class
- for each tuple, calculate \(sign(dist(A,X) - dist(B,X))\), where \(dist(i,j)\) is euclidean distance between model's vector representations of syllables /i/ and /j/
- +ve sign indicates that the model has learned to discriminate the VH classes in A and B
